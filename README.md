# andelys

A replacement for the World Wide Web.  Simple, reliable, programmable, fast, and secure.

## licence

andelys is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html).

### why the LGPL?

The GPL is specifically designed to reduce the usefulness of GPL-licensed code to closed-source, proprietary software. The BSD license (and similar) don't mandate code-sharing if the BSD-licensed code is modified by licensees. The LGPL achieves the best of both worlds: an LGPL-licensed library can be incorporated within closed-source proprietary code, and yet those using an LGPL-licensed library are required to release source code to that library if they change it.

Also, andelys is built upon Racket (formerly PLT Scheme) and Racket is also licensed under the LGPL.

### why 2.1?

andelys is built on top of Racket, which is [itself licensed](http://download.racket-lang.org/license.html) under the LGPL v2.1.
