## licence

andelys is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html).

### why the LGPL?

The GPL is specifically designed to reduce the usefulness of GPL-licensed code to closed-source, proprietary software. The BSD license (and similar) don't mandate code-sharing if the BSD-licensed code is modified by licensees. The LGPL achieves the best of both worlds: an LGPL-licensed library can be incorporated within closed-source proprietary code, and yet those using an LGPL-licensed library are required to release source code to that library if they change it.

### why 2.1?

andelys is built upon [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) (formerly PLT Scheme) and Racket is [itself licensed](http://download.racket-lang.org/license.html) under the LGPL v2.1.
